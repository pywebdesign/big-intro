# Introducing Zyocoin

Bitcoin is only as strong as its weakest link, and right now the weak
link is clearly the central exchanges. MtGox in particular has done
irreparable harm to the reputation of Bitcoin; no single entity has
been more damaging to the entire community. The Bitcoin community is
coiled to launch in other directions. Since the latest Gox incident,
multiple teams of talented, experienced, capable software developers
have begun working around the clock to oust MtGox from the scene with
their superior, free and open source trading engines.

It's obvious that Bitcoin needs to decentralize the exchanges, and open
source trading engines can only help. But this merely makes it easier
for people to open new exchanges. It does nothing to ensure a more
even distribution of market share. It makes a game of whack-a-mole more
possible, but that's a temporary solution and hardly a workable one if
Bitcoin is to gain global marketshare.

When people say they want P2P exchanges, ultimately what they seek is
guaranteed 24/7 liquidity between Bitcoin and locally attainable goods
and services. Typically these goods are offered in USD/EUR/GBP/JPY.

In light of this, the USD/BTC pairing is a **layer of abstraction**. What
individuals *really* need to know is what a Bitcoin buys you.

Therefore, a more accurate exchange rate is conceivable, one that may
benefit from being readily convertible to USD/BTC, without depending on
any central exchange to arrive at a price per BTC.

**Introducing Zyocoin**

Zyocoin isn't a new currency. It's a math formula: ZYC = (MSID x PC) + UX.

- MSID: Multi-Signature Issued Debt  
- PC: p(Collect)  
- UX: User Experience

Zyocoin significantly increases the liquidity of Bitcoin by incentivizing
participation in a distributed marketplace for real goods and services,
of which may be offered in USD/EUR/GBP/JPY etc.

The marketplace itself is distributed in software form, and optionally
allows trusted users to issue ZYC as debt. This is accomplished using
colored coins, such that the debt is verifiable by the blockchain and
utilizes native blockchain features for a pure P2P model.
